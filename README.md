# Customer-Behavior-Analysis
This project analyzes customer behavior across multiple products to identify patterns such as product views and purchases. SQL is used for data extraction, and Python is utilized for data cleaning, visualization, and predictive modeling. The findings aim to influence product feature enhancements and marketing strategies.

# Technologies Used

Python: Data processing and modeling

SQLite: Simulating SQL database for querying

Pandas: Data cleaning and transformation

Matplotlib/Seaborn: Data visualization

Scikit-learn: Predictive modeling

# Dataset

A simulated dataset is created within the project, representing actions (like 'view' and 'purchase') taken by customers on different products. You can modify this dataset or connect it to a real customer behavior dataset.

# Features

Data Extraction: SQL queries to extract relevant data.

Data Cleaning: Handled missing values and transformed timestamps.

Data Visualization: Plotted customer actions and trends over time.

Predictive Modeling: Built a model to predict customer behavior (view/purchase).

# Usage

Data Extraction and Cleaning

The data is extracted from a local SQLite database and then cleaned using Pandas. Run the following code in the provided script to inspect and clean the data.

# Results

Action Distribution: Insights into how customers interact with products.

Trends Over Time: Customer purchase patterns based on the time of day.

Predictive Accuracy: The Random Forest model can be further refined, showing potential for behavioral prediction.
